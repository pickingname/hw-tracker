### developing
To run the project locally, first install pnpm first if you dont have

```bash
npm i pnpm
```


Then install the dependencies:

```bash
pnpm i
```

Next, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

if you dont have npm, download it [here](https://nodejs.org)

after you runned `pnpm i` you should have node_modules folder, after that you do not need to run the `pnpm i` just run `pnpm dev`
